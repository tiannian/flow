# Flow
> script to process flow data(include audio, video, autometa, MIDI, or some others).

[中文文档](README.zh.md)

Today's audio and video processing tools (including DAW, editors, effects, etc.) still use traditional algorithms to process and analyze data. With the development of big data and AI, we have a more efficient way to process data to achieve better, but the design of existing tools is difficult to work with new algorithms and system. The goal of Flow is to create a new tool for processing streaming data such as audio and video, automatic control, and Midi sequences, as well as docking traditional plug-ins (VST, OpenFX, etc.) with existing big data and AI systems ( Tensorflow, Coffee), etc.
